## Description
This is my portfolio using the React.js framework. It showcases my skill to build a functioning react app with the capability to navigate through multiple different pages as well as click on the many links that are on the pages to go to my profiles on different sites. There is a form to be able to contact me by entering a name, email, and message. There is a page to view my projects that I have done with links to navigate to the GitHub repositories. Lastly there is a page to be able to view the technologies I have learned with a buttun to be able to download my resume.

Here is the link to the deployed application on Netlify: https://main--kylegru.netlify.app/
